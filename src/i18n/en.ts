    label: "FAQ",
    title: "Frequently Asked Questions",
    items: [
      { q: "Do I need prior programming experience?", a: "Basic programming knowledge is recommended but not strictly required. AI TechProducts is designed for people who want to build — you'll learn fundamentals as you create real products. The key is willingness to understand, not just generate." },
      { q: "How long is the AI TechProducts program?", a: "Each cycle is 3 months, divided into 3-4 week sprints. You'll build a minimum of 3 deployed AI products during this time, with weekly consultations for feedback and guidance." },
      { q: "Can I use any AI tool?", a: "Yes! Claude Code, Cursor, Windsurf, Lovable, no-code platforms — use whatever helps you build. The difference is that you must understand and explain what the tools produced. We embrace tools; we reject blind dependency." },
      { q: "What's the difference between AI TechProducts and other bootcamps?", a: "Traditional bootcamps teach you to follow tutorials. AI TechProducts requires you to build real products, deploy them with real users, and prove you understand the fundamentals. Your portfolio is made of live products, not homework assignments." },
      { q: "How does the Umbral platform work?", a: "Umbral is your control center — it tracks your deployed projects, the fundamentals you've mastered, your iteration history, and your learning documentation. Think of it as a living portfolio that proves you built with understanding." },
      { q: "Are scholarships available?", a: "Yes. We're committed to democratizing access. Scholarship details for the next cohort will be announced when we open registrations. Follow our social media to stay informed." },
      { q: "Are events in-person or virtual?", a: "We offer both! Our hackathons are typically in-person (like AI Hackathon Peru at UPCH), while bootcamps and the AI TechProducts program include virtual components to reach all of Latin America." },
